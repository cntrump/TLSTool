/*! A base class shared by the s_client and s_server command code.
 *  \details This is where the bulk of the networking code exists. The subclasses 
 *  just set up the streams correctly and then call down here to do the real work.
 * 
 *  This code's main function is to manage the input and output streams:
 *
 *  - For the input stream, it reads any data that arrives on the stream and 
 *    writes it to stdout.
 *
 *  - For the output stream, it reads any data that arrives on stdin and writes 
 *    it to the stream.
